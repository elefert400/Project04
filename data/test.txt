*****every check you make needs to have a constant in check_constants

enemy list decrements when enemy:
  is hit
  hits bottom of screen

enemy list increments when enemy spawned
  -implemented on line 190, returns true when length of the list goes up by one, may want to go back and change it so that it doesn't have to print out four true statements, but since there is only 5 enemies I left it like this

enemy shot list increments when shot fired
  -implemented the same way as the enemy list

enemies stop spawning when MAX_ENEMIES is reached
  -on line 199 put check to see if over the max but not sure where to put check if its 5
  -did a check after while loop to  make sure the enemy count = the max enemies

enemy stops shooting when MAX_ENEMY_SHOT is reached
  -implemented the same way as check was for MAX_ENEMIES

correct heart image is shown when health list changes
